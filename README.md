### Project Goal: Fast and Robust Trajectory Optimization for the Rocket Soft-Landing Problem

With extensions to other second-order cone programs.

---

#### Overview
A native Julia library to solve trajectory optimization problems that contain
second-order cone constraints.

#### Who and How?
Author: Daniel Neamati (Summer 2020) ([Please also see my Portfolio](https://sites.google.com/view/danielneamati/))

Advisor: Prof. Zachary Manchester ([REx Lab at Stanford University](https://rexlab.stanford.edu/))

Funding graciously provided by Caltech SURF program and the Homer J. Stewart Fellowship.

#### Do you want to contribute? Here are some next steps
1. The last SOCP capabilities are currently in the works. (This will be done soon)
2. MonteCarlo simulation framework.
3. More descriptive dynamics.
4. Integrate into the [TrajectoryOptimization.jl](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/TrajectoryOptimization.jl) framework.
